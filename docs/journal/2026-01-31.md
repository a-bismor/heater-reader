## Project: heater-reader
- Goal: local boiler LCD OCR monitor (temps + mode) with graphs and manual correction.
- Environment: Ubuntu always-on machine, camera via RTSP/ONVIF, local web dashboard.
- Storage: SQLite, images on disk.
- UI: dashboard with charts + in-dashboard correction with image preview.
- TDD required for all new features/bugfixes.

## Decisions
- Approach: Python service + FastAPI UI + OpenCV/Tesseract OCR.
- Data model: readings + edits + capture_errors tables, effective values via COALESCE.
- Mode labels: PRACA / PODTRZYMANIE (unknown => UNKNOWN).

## Risks/Notes
- OCR accuracy will need tuning with crop coordinates and preprocessing.
- Capture failures must be visible; retry once and continue.
- Manual correction workflow is core; do not defer.
